                <p>In 1972, PES was founded in Bangalore with just over 40 students.Today, we have more than 18,000 students spread across four different campuses in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
                    <br /><br />It is our unwavering commitment to the highest quality education that has sped us along on this journey.I would also like to thank the generations of parents who have entrusted us with the care and education of their children.It is their faith and belief in the PES values – Perseverance, Excellence and Service – that has helped us come this far.
                    I believe that education has the most critical role to play in the progress of a nation.We realize that our students represent the future of our society and we take our responsibility seriously.We ensure that the rock-solid foundation we help them build here – both, in terms of skills and values – will stand them in good stead no matter which career they choose.
                    Along with the requisite academic and related skills, we try and instill empathy for the less fortunate in our students and a concern for the environment around them.<br /><br />We create opportunities not just for young people to learn, but also for them to experience the fulfillment that comes from sharing this learning with others.At PES, we will always be focused on delivering education that will help create the leaders of tomorrow’s world –
                    men and women who will not just be successful in their individual capacities, but who will in turn, contribute to and nurture the world they live in.</p>
